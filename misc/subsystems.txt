New subsystems are created using the CRTSBSD command.

If you want to submit a job to run under a particular subsystem, you
should do the following steps :

  1. Create a new job queue using the CRTJOBQ command.
  2. Add this job queue to a specified subsystem using the ADDJOBQE
     command.
  3. Submit the job specifying the job queue under which you want
     to run the program.

An example of this is the submit command from KISTRESACL program :

   SBMJOB     CMD(CALL PGM(KIESA01CL)) JOB(&JOBNM1)  +
                JOBQ(CPFESA) LOG(*JOBD *JOBD *NOLIST) +
                LOGCLPGM(*NO)


The CPFESA job queue is an entry in the CPFESA subsystem so instead
of running in the default subsystem QBATCH, it will run under CPFESA.
